# BLAST in Embedding Space

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a novel method for conducting the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm over embedding space rather than raw sequence data. By leveraging modern machine learning techniques and embedding methods, we seek to improve the speed and sensitivity of sequence similarity searches in bioinformatics.

## Project Goals

1. Develop a new BLAST-like algorithm that operates on sequence embeddings
2. Improve search speed and sensitivity compared to traditional BLAST
3. Create a user-friendly interface for the new algorithm
4. Publish findings in a peer-reviewed journal
